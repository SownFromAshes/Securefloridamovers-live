                            <p class="fq-answer">You can get a quote by filling out our online form or calling us. We provide <strong>binding, flat-rate quotes</strong> for long-distance moves (the price won't change) and detailed hourly estimates for local moves. Be wary of companies offering vague, non-binding estimates, as this often leads to surprise fees.</p>

                            <summary class="fq-question">How far in advance should I book my movers?</summary>
                            <p class="fq-answer">We recommend booking at least 4-6 weeks in advance, especially if you're moving during the peak season (May-September) or at the end of the month. The earlier you book, the more likely you are to secure your preferred date.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">Declutter! The volume and weight of your items are major cost factors. Go through every room and decide what to sell, donate, or discard. The less we have to move, the more you save. This is the single most effective cost-saving measure you can take.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">If your budget allows, our professional packing service saves you dozens of hours and significantly reduces the risk of damage. If you choose to self-pack, we recommend using high-quality materials. For fragile or high-value items, we always suggest letting our experts handle the packing.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">If possible, use the original boxes. If not, use a sturdy box with plenty of padding (packing paper or bubble wrap). Take photos of cable setups before unplugging. Label all cords and pack them in the same box as the corresponding electronic device. Never use newspaper, as the ink can transfer.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">This is a critical step. You'll need to submit a change of address with the USPS, transfer utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet) to your new address, update your driver's license, and notify your bank, credit card companies, and any subscription services of your new address.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">Our uniformed crew will arrive on time, introduce themselves, and do a walkthrough of your home. We will then lay down protective coverings for floors and door jambs before beginning to load the truck. Your role is simply to be available to answer any questions we might have.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">For local moves, you can typically leave light clothing in drawers. For long-distance moves, or for dressers that are particularly heavy or fragile, it's best to empty them. All breakable items, valuables, and heavy items should always be removed and packed separately.</p>

                            <p class="fq-answer">We accept all major credit cards, certified checks, and cash. Payment for the estimated time on local moves is typically due upon completion of the move. For long-distance moves, a deposit is taken upon booking, with the remainder due upon delivery, before unloading begins.</p>

                            <summary class="fq-question">Should I tip the movers?</summary>
                            <p class="fq-answer">While not required, tipping is a customary way to show appreciation for excellent service. A standard tip is typically 15-20% of the total moving cost, which can be divided among the crew members. You can give the tip to the crew lead at the end of the move.</p>

As a fully licensed and insured mover, your move is protected.
