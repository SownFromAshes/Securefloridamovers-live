                        <p class="fq-answer">This is our primary policy that covers against accidental damage to your property (e.g., walls, floors, doorways) during the move. We carry a comprehensive $1,000,000 per-occurrence policy, which satisfies the requirements of even the strictest building management companies. A Certificate of Insurance (COI) can be provided upon request.</p>

                        <p class="fq-answer">This policy covers your actual belongings while they are in our possession. By law, all movers must provide basic "Released Value Protection" at no additional charge, which covers $0.60 per pound per item. For more comprehensive coverage, we highly recommend purchasing <strong>Full Value Protection (FVP)</strong>. FVP ensures that in the event of loss or damage, your item will be repaired, replaced with a similar item, or a cash settlement will be offered for its current market value. Please ask your moving coordinator for a quote on FVP.</p>

                        <p class="fq-answer">This is a critical, often overlooked policy. We carry full Workers' Compensation insurance for all our employees. This protects you, the homeowner, from any liability in the unlikely event that a mover is injured on your property. Hiring a company without this policy exposes you to significant financial risk.</p>

Report:</strong> Notify your crew lead of any damage before they leave your property. <strong>2. Document:</strong> Take clear photos of the damage from multiple angles. <strong>3. Submit:</strong> Contact our office within 90 days to formally submit your written claim with the photos. Our team will then promptly begin the resolution process to repair, replace, or settle the claim fairly.</p>
